# Uncle Escape App 🚪😂

## 📌 Project Overview
This app measures how many times uncles ask *"When are you getting married?"* at family functions.  
It then generates funny **escape routes** using a map API.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User opens the app during a family function.
2. Each time someone asks the question, they press a counter button.
3. The app logs the count.
4. Once the count exceeds a threshold, the app generates an **escape map** with directions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Frontend: React Native
- Backend: Firebase
- Maps: Google Maps API

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Voice detection (so the app automatically detects the question).
- Share escape maps with friends.
